# Inside Outside
This is a simulated VR application built using WebGL, serving as a research probe for my Honours thesis which supports reflective processes in VR. Inside Outside explores design strategies which are aimed to invoke self-awareness in VR and invite users to reflect on their everyday lives through day-to-day narratives.

## Live link
There are three prototypes depending on which character you would like to play as (while all characters display the same story, it is recommended that you choose Michelle for the best experience). This should open the Unity deployment in your web browser (it uses WebGL), and the prototype should run straight away after loading. If this does not work, you may alternatively open and run the project using the Unity editor (instructions for opening the project in Unity is outlined below). If possible, please try to close other CPU or GPU intensive applications that may be running in the background.

## How to open in Unity
To view the code and project in Unity, you will firstly need to download and install Unity Hub, with `Unity version 2019.4.3` (this is a Unity Long Term Support). Then, clone the GitHub repository to your desktop.

Using Unity Hub, click `Add` and add the `InsideOutside` folder located inside the repository to open the project in the editor. You may now see the constituents of the project. To play the application using the Unity in-editor player, navigate to the Scenes folder and open the scene titled `0Tutorial.` Click play on the top of the Unity editor. Note that when playing the application in the editor, some lighting does not render correctly. This seems to be a Unity in-editor bug
