# Inside Oututside
Simulated VR application built using WebGL.

## How to open in Unity
To view the code and project in Unity, you will firstly need to download and install Unity Hub, with Unity version 2019.4.3 (this is a Unity Long Term Support). Then, clone the GitHub repository to your desktop.

Using Unity Hub, click _Add_ and add the _InsideOutside_ folder located inside the repository to open the project in the editor. You may now see the constituents of the project. To play the application using the Unity in-editor player, navigate to the Scenes folder and open the scene titled ‘0Tutorial.’ Click play on the top of the Unity editor. Note that when playing the application in the editor, some lighting does not render correctly. This seems to be a Unity in-editor bug
